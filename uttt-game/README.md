## How to Play Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

Ultimate Tic Tac Toe takes the classic game of Tic Tac Toe to the next level. It consists of a 3x3 grid of mini Tic Tac Toe boards. Here's how to play:

1. **Start Anywhere** : The first player can place their 'X' or 'O' in any cell within any mini-board.
2. **Dictated Moves** : The cell within the mini-board that the first player chooses dictates which mini-board the next player must play in. For example, if Player 1 places an 'X' in the top right cell of any mini-board, Player 2 must play somewhere in the top right mini-board.
3. **Free Choice** : If a player is sent to a mini-board that has been completed (won by 'X' or 'O', or a draw), that player can choose any other mini-board to play in.
4. **Win Mini-Boards** : Win mini-boards by getting three of your marks in a row - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
5. **Win the Game** : To win the game, you need to win three mini-boards in a row, just like the classic game.

The game continues until the main board is won, or there are no moves left, resulting in a draw.
