        <h1>Welcome to my first website!</h1>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal with this website is to aquire expierence and demonstrate skill in the following areas: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web Development</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>Javascript</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Git</li>
            <li>Logic and Algorithms</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>Graphical User Interfaces</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To accomplish these goals, I intend to create an Ultimate Tic Tac Toe game.</p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>This game would support the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A GUI for the best player experience</li>
            <li>Ability for a human opponent to connect</li>
            <li>An AI opponent with a configurable difficulty level</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <p>Just like in regular tic-tac-toe, the two players (X and O) take turns, starting with X. The game starts with X playing wherever they want in any of the 81 empty spots. Next the opponent plays, however they are forced to play in the small board indicated by the relative location of the previous move. For example, if X plays in the top right square of a small (3 Ã— 3) board, then O has to play in the small board located at the top right of the larger board. Playing any of the available spots decides in which small board the next player plays.</p>
        <p>If a move is played so that it is to win a small board by the rules of normal tic-tac-toe, then the entire small board is marked as won by the player in the larger board. Once a small board is won by a player or it is filled completely, no more moves may be played in that board. If a player is sent to such a board, then that player may play in any other board. Game play ends when either a player wins the larger board or there are no legal moves remaining, in which case the game is a draw.</p>
